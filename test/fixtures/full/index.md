# This is a demo

Here is a paragraph with _some emphasis_ and some **strong text**, and a
[link](http://google.com). I ~~did~~ want to fix this.

## Code

This is some `inline code` in a paragraph.

Now here a fenced code block!

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Lists

- List of things
- With a [link](http://google.com)
- And just an `inline code bit`

And now for this ordered list...

1. First
1. Second
1. Bronze

### Nested Lists

- List of things
  - Sub list of things
  - With another item
- And a final top level thing

With a little paragraph:

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and working.
1. Start the development container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose run app bash
    ```
1. Follow instructions in the "Setting up the project and Serverless" section.

## Tables

Yeah standard, like this table here...

| First Header   | Second Header  |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Bit of Content | Second Content |
| Another Row    | Third Content  |

And a table with ordering:

| First | Second | Third |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| Left  | Centre | Right |
